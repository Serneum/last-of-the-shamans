# The Cabin
## Goal
Survive until morning.

## Overview
You've made it through ***[The Clearing](The%20Clearing.md)*** and into ***The Cabin***. You know it has been several hours since you awoke back in your camp and sunrise will be coming soon. Once it does, you will be safe...for now. The shack is small but contains several rooms. You are currently in what appears to be a living room, and you can see what you believe to be a bedroom as well as a kitchen and dining area.

## Moments
- The smell of dust and old wood
- A locket abandoned on the floor, containing a picture of someone precious.
- Cooking utensils left behind. A pot still containing a foul-smelling liquid.
- The windows are boarded up, letting in almost no light.
- The bed not made, and the sheets are stained.

## Props
- A small mirror hanging by the door

## Traps
- Another Shaman will appear at the door. The players recognize him but they are not sure why (he is in the locket). If the players let him in, he will scurry around and try to find a place to feel safe (a vampire must be invited in). The players may question him. One way or another, he will reveal himself as Radu. The players may fight Radu, but they will lose.
  - *Ask the players to describe the person in the locket when it is found. Hint that something seems odd about the newcomer.*

## Treasures
