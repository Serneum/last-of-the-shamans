# The Clearing
#### Goal
Find a way into ***[The Cabin](The%20Cabin.md)***

#### Overview
As you exit the forest, you stand at the top of a hill. The hill slopes down into a wide clearing, and you can tell that this is partially man-made. Several trees have clearly been cut down and only their stumps remain. In the middle of the clearing is a wooden cabin. Near the cabin is a well, and off in the distance is an outhouse. As you look closer, you also see a small pond. You feel exposed, but surely *everything is fine*.

#### Moments
- Hollowed-out tree trunk full of loose coins and scraps of clothing.
- The smell of stagnant water and rotting flesh.
- No sounds. It is eerily quiet.
- The feeling of being watched.

#### Props
- **The Well** - The well is partially ctumbled, but the mechanism that lowers the bucket is still functional.
- **The Cabin** - A symbol of Danaus is painted on the door, though it has been made profane in some way. *How has the image been altered?*
- **The Pond** - The pond smells of death. Upon closer inspection, all of the aquatic life is floating at the top of the water.
- **The Outhouse** - The door is locked. Groans can be heard coming from inside.

#### Traps
- If the players did not alert any [hounds](../Monsters/Shadow%20Hound.md) in ***[The Forest](The%20Forest.md)***, the [hounds](../Monsters/Shadow%20Hound.md) will pick up their scent and appear in ***The Clearing***
- Inside of the outhouse is a ***[walker](../Monsters/Walker.md)***
- If the players aproach the pond, they will encounter a ***crawling [walker](../Monsters/Walker.md)***

#### Treasures
- At the bottom of the well is a silver dagger

#### Monsters
- [Walker](../Monsters/Walker.md)
- [Shadow Hound](../Monsters/Shadow%20Hound.md)
