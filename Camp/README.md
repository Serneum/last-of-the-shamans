# Camp
---

## Goal
- Find equipment, save who you can
- Learn about the Shamans. Ask the players to describe themselves.
- Enter ***The Forest***

## Overview
*Ask the players to describe their camp before beginning*  
You awaken near the campfire in the middle of the night. Something seems wrong, the forest is silent. You hear screams, then growls. The camp is under attack and your equipment is back in your tent.

## Moments
- Crackling, but the campfire is out
- The deep, rich smell of wet soil mingled with the smell of blood
- Shredded tents, the fabric flapping in the light breeze
- Weather-beaten lyre used to fill the silence with song
- Another small groups of Shamans

## Props
- Tents, barrels, various weapons lying on the ground
- Other groups of shamans are around. They may join you.

## Traps
- A ***ghoul*** is blocking the path to your tent. If the Shamans alert it to their presence, they will need to fight
  - Depending on when the **ghoul** is encountered, it may have already killed someone. If **ghoul** is not found within D4 turns, have the party make a Ruin Roll.

## Treasures
- If the Shamans make it to their tent, they can pick up their own equipment. Otherwise, they must scavenge what they can. Allow the players to guide the scavenging.
