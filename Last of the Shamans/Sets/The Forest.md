# The Forest

## Goal
Make your way through the forest. Find ***[The Clearing](The%20Clearing.md)***

## Overview
It's a forest. Let the players guide their exploration. Throw in some road blocks as needed, but allow them to come up with solutions. Ex: There's a river blocking the way, perhaps they find a downed tree to help cross. Hopefully they don't fall.

## Moments
- Collection of small religious icons arranged into a shrine, each icon familiar to the party (Danaus, Shaman symbols)
- The smell of burnt flesh.
- Huddle of burnt corpses surrounding a funeral pyre, arms around each other.
- Motion out of the corner of your eye.

## Props
- **The Cave** - The cave is small, but provides protection from the elements, and could provide a good hiding place.
- **The Shrine** - A small shrine is found under an overhang that provides cover. It can reduce Panic if the players are too close to their limit.

## Traps
- Inside of the cave is a group of burnt corpses.
- [Shadow hounds](../Monsters/Shadow%20Hound.md) stalk through the forest. Their keen senses will pick up any noise the Shamans make.
- [Bats](../Monsters/Swarm%20of%20Bats.md) sleep in the cave. If the players enter the cave for any reason, the bats will awaken.

## Treasures
- The shrine contains small religious icons. They can act as holy symbols if the players take them.
- The cave contains a small book, partially charred. If the players inspect it, they can learn the Kindle ritual at the cost of 1 Panic.

## Monsters
- [Shadow Hound](../Monsters/Shadow%20Hound.md)
- [Swarm of Bats](../Monsters/Swarm%20of%20Bats.md)
