# Last of the Shamans
A Trophy Dark incursion, utilizing archetypes from Emberwind.
---

## Notes
- Allow players to create their characters. They need names, a class, 3-4 things they are good at based on the class and their background  
- Allow one Ritual for free  
- Give a hint to the theme. Weaknesses will include fire, light, silver, blades, etc
- Desperation  
- Reduction rolls are when character attempts subtle acts of sabotage against other players.
- Try to force the players to feel a desire to survive in a way that also pushes them to be faster than the others running from the bear, so-to-speak
- Players should feel tension and the impending doom. Whatever is trying to get them is always close, and getting closer
- Players should not feel completely hopeless. We want them to feel like they have a chance to survive the Incursion, and they can. But an epilogue will kill them anyway
- Weaknesses can be learned, at a cost. Determine what that cost may be, find a way to work it into the scenario
- Find a way to make Hunt Rolls useful. Gold is not the only currency. Give something value and allow players to find it.
